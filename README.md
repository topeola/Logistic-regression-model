# Logistic-regression-model

## The task is to build a model that uses the input features to predict whether an applicant will default
## I have used logistic regression modelling and a R script has been attached in which I perform steps such as explore features of the 
## data, impute missing data, and assess the performance metrics of the model

## The dataset used for this project is one obtained from SAS Enterprise Miner
## Dataset has 12 input variables and 1 target variable
## Input variables and their descriptions are as follows;
## CLAGE - Age of oldest credit line in months
## CLNO - Number of credit lines
## Debtinc - Debt-to-income ratio
## Delinq  - Number of delinquent credit lines
## Derog   - Number of major derogatory reports
## Job     - Occupational categories
## Loan    - Amount of Loan request
## Mortdue - Amount due on existing mortgage
## NINQ    - Number of recent credit inquiries
## Reason  - Debtcon = debt consolidation, HomeImp = Home Improvement
## Value   - Value of Current Property

## The target variable is "Bad" and it is a binary variable with 2 levels where 1 = applicant defaulted on loan or is seriously delinquent
## and 0 = applicant paid loan

## Approximately 20% of the the applicants in the dataset have defaulted on loans.
